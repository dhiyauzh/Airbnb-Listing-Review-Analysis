## Introduction
This is a group project of 4 people including me as final project to pass Business intelligence course in my program. We choose a public dataset that contain listing and review from Airbnb which retrieved from maven analytics (...). We are assigned to find business insights from a public dataset using Tableu as data analytics tool. Airbnb Listing & Review dataset contains data for 250,000+ listings in 10 major cities, including information about hosts, pricing, location, and room type, along with over 5 million historical reviews. 
We wanted to produce valueable information for potential investor who wants to list their property in Airbnb platform. We wanted to give suggestion which is the best city to build properties, what type of building, and which market is suitable for each type of investor.
